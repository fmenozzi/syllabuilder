                <h3> Logging In </h3>
                <p>
                Log in using your UNC Onyen and password.
                </p>

                <h3> Choosing A Semester </h3>
                <p>
                Choose which semester you wish to create a syllabus for (calendar will auto-update).
                Note that you can load a syllabus from a different semester on the editor page.
                </p>

                <h3> Saving A Syllabus </h3>
                <p>
                To save a syllabus, you must give it a title (which applies to the syllabus itself, and not the course) and click Save.
                </p>

                <h3> Loading A Syllabus </h3>
                <p>
                To load an existing syllabus, select its title from the dropdown menu and click Load. 
                </p>

                <h3> Creating Your Syllabus </h3>
                <p>
                Begin with the Course Information section, which includes basic details about its listing, logistics, and instructor. 
                All fields are required except those marked as optional.
                <br><br>
                The details of each section can then be filled in with the different tabs of the text editor. Clicking on a tab will allow you to 
                fill out its section, and any text you enter will be preserved as you switch between tabs. Note that some sections, such as the Honor Code,
                have suggested language already filled in, but be sure to review these sections and make any edits needed.
                </p>

                <h3> Filling The Schedule </h3>
                <p>
                After selecting the weekday(s) in the Course Meeting section, the schedule (below the text editor) will automatically
                create an entry for each day of the semester that the class will meet upon. On each day, the content
                for that day and the homework for the next class (or due on that day) can be entered.
                </p>

                <h3> Previewing / Exporting Your Syllabus </h3>
                <p>
                With the Preview button, you can view a simple HTML mockup of your syllabus, with missing information highlighted in red. 
                Note that the actual layout of the exported syllabus (in .docx format) will vary slightly from this preview.
                <br><br>
                To export your syllabus to a .docx document that will be downloaded to your computer, use the Export button. 
                </p>
